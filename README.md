Welcome to my Website AromaExperts!

My website is about a spa or a complementary service that provides physial aromatherapy.

The home page provides a few pointers on what our service is about and what it provides for clients and a sign up button at the bottom of the page that navigates them to the sign up page. tHe homepage has a very simplistic layout with an example image at the right handisde of the page of what products would be presented to the clients as part of the service.

On the about webpage, it explains the different products used during the customer's session with the aromatherapist.
THey are also encourgaed to pick and choose which oils they would prefer to use.
